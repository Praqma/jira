# NOTICE OF DEPRECATION

If you are not yet aware. Atlassian now provides Helm charts and images for the running of their Data Center products on Kubernetes.

Therefore we will deprecate our implementation known as Atlassian Software in Kubernetes (ASK) as we believe that Atlassian is in the best position to provide a deployment model like this.

Please see Atlassian's documentation for running Data Center products on Kubernetes.

- [Documentation](https://atlassian.github.io/data-center-helm-charts/)
- [Github repo](https://github.com/atlassian/data-center-helm-charts)

This means we will no longer update or maintain ASK repositories nor push new images to Docker Hub. 

You are therefor encouraged to push any images you presently use to a registry of your choice and clone/fork this repository if needed.

Other repositories affected by this are:

- https://github.com/Praqma/ask - Helm Chart (ASK)
- https://github.com/Praqma/confluence - Confluence docker image (ASK)
- https://github.com/Praqma/bitbucket - Bitbucket docker image (ASK)

# Atlassian Software in Kubernetes (ASK) - Jira

![ASK-Logo](images/ask-logo.png)

This respository is a component of **[ASK](https://www.praqma.com/products/ask/) Atlassian Software in Kubernetes** ; and holds program-code to create Docker image for Jira Software (not Jira Core). 

Although the title says "Atlassian Software in Kubernetes", the container image can be run on plain Docker/Docker-Compose/Docker-Swarm, etc. 

This image can be used to run a single / stand-alone  instance of Jira Software or a clustered setup known as Jira DataCenter. You simply need to enable certain environment variables to get that done.

The source-code in this repository is released under MIT License, but the actual docker container images (binaries) built by it are not. You are free to use this source-code to build your own Jira docker images and host them whereever you want. Please remember to consider various Atlassian and Oracle related lincense limitations when doing so.  

## Main features
- Uses Fedora 30 as base image.
- Uses Atlassian Jira binary installer, which comes with Adopt JDK/JRE in the newer installers.
- Exposes port 8080
- Supports data center mode and self signed certs.
- Can be setup behind a reverse proxy by setting up certain proxy related environment variables as mentioned below.


## Usage

### Build:

First, you need to build the container image

```shell
docker build -t local/jira:version-tag .
```

### Usage:
In it's simplest form, this image can be used by executing:

```shell
$ docker run -p 8080:8080 -d local/jira:version-tag

$Â docker ps

CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                    NAMES
2585785edf49        local/jira          "/opt/atlassian/jira/"   3 seconds ago       Up 2 seconds        0.0.0.0:8080->8080/tcp   stupefied_wing
```


If you want to set it up behind a reverse proxy, use the following command:

```shell
$ docker run  \
  -e X_PROXY_NAME=<<YOUR_PROXY_NAME>> \
  -e X_PROXY_PORT=<<YOUR_PROXY_PORT>> \
  -e X_PROXY_SCHEME=<<YOUR_PROXY_SCHEME>> \
  -e X_CONTEXT_PATH=<<YOUR_X_CONTEXT_PATH>> \
  -e .... other variables ... \
  -p 8080:8080  \
  -d local/jira:version-tag
```


**Note:** When setting up Jira behind a (GCE/AWS/other) proxy/load balancer, make sure to setup proxy/load-balancer timeouts to large values such as 300 secs or more. (The default is set to 60 secs). It is **very** important to setup these timeouts, as Jira (and other atlassian software) can take significant time setting up initial database. Smaller timeouts will panic Jira setup process and it will terminate.

If you run without providing any exisiting database, JIRA will run and will present you with the web-setup wizard:

```shell
docker run \
  -p 8080:8080  \
  -d local/jira:version-tag
```

If you want to use a different JIRA version, then simply change the version number in the Dockerfile, and rebuild the image.


## Certificates

Supply additional certificates from a single mounted directory.

```shell
docker run \
    --detach \
    --name container-name \
    --publish 8080:8080 \
    --volume /path/to/certificates:/var/atlassian/ssl \
    --volume /path/to/jira-plugins.list:/tmp/jira-plugins.list \
    local/image:tag
```

See `SSL_CERTS_PATH` ENV variable in [Dockerfile](Dockerfile).

Similar output should be shown by `docker logs container-name`.

```text
Importing certificate: /var/atlassian/ssl/eastwind.crt ...
Certificate was added to keystore
Importing certificate: /var/atlassian/ssl/northwind.crt ...
Certificate was added to keystore
Importing certificate: /var/atlassian/ssl/southwind.pem ...
Certificate was added to keystore
Importing certificate: /var/atlassian/ssl/westwind.pem ...
Certificate was added to keystore
```

## User provided plugins:
If you want to add plugins of your choice, you can list their IDs in `jira-plugins.list` file , one plugin at each line. You can volume-mount this file inside JIRA_INSTALL - as `JIRA_INSTALL/jira-plugins.list` . The `docker-entrypoint.sh` script will process this file and install the plugins. You can customize the location of this file in Dockerfile by setting the PLUGINS_FILE environment var to that location.

```shell
docker run \
  -p 8080:8080  \
  -v ${PWD}/jira-plugins.list:/tmp/jira-plugins.list \
  -d local/jira:version-tag
```


## Environment variables

The following environment variables can be set when building your docker image.


| Env name | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      	| Defaults                        	|
|------------------------------	|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|---------------------------------	|
| JIRA_VERSION                 	| The version number which is part of the name of the jira software bin/tarball/zip.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               	| 8.4.0                          	|
| DATACENTER_MODE              	| This needs to be set to 'true' if you want to setup Jira in a data-center mode. Need different lincense for this                                                                                                                                                                                                 	| false                           	|
| JIRA_DATACENTER_SHARE        	| It needs to be a shared location, which multiple jira instances can write to. This location will most probably be an NFS share, and should exist on the file system.  If it does not exist, then it will be created and chown to the jira OS user.  NB: For this to work, DATACENTER_MODE should be set to true. 	| /var/atlassian/jira-datacenter  	|
| TZ_FILE                      	| Timezone. Set the path of the correct zone you want to use for your container. Can be set at runtime as well                                                                                                                                                                                                     	| /usr/share/zoneinfo/Europe/Oslo 	|
| OS_USERNAME	| Jira bin-installer automatically creates a 'jira' user and a 'jira' group. Just specify what it's name is. | jira	|
| OS_GROUPNAME	| Jira bin-installer automatically creates a 'jira' user and a 'jira' group. Just specify what it's name is. | jira	|
| JIRA_HOME	| This is where run-time data will be saved. It needs persistent storage. This can be mounted on mount-point inside container. It needs to be owned by the same UID as of user jira, normally UID 1000. The value if this variable should be same as 'app.jiraHome' in the jira-response.varfile file. | /var/atlassian/application-data/jira |
| JIRA_INSTALL	| This is where Jira software will be installed. Persistent storage is NOT needed. The value if this variable should be same as 'sys.installationDir' in the jira-response.varfile file. | /opt/atlassian/jira |
| JAVA_OPTS | Optional values you want to pass as JAVA_OPTS. You can pass Java memory parameters to this variable, but in newer versionso of Atlassian software, memory settings are done in CATALINA_OPTS. |  |
| CATLINA_OPTS | CATALINA_OPTS will be used by CONFLUENCE_INSTALL/bin/setenv.sh script . You can use this to setup internationalization options, and also any Java memory settings. It is a good idea to use same value for -Xms and -Xmx to avoid frequence shrinking and expanding of Java memory. e.g. `CATALINA_OPTS "-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -Xms1024m -Xmx1024m"` . The memory values should always be half (or less) of physical RAM of the server/node/pod/container. |  `CATALINA_OPTS "-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -Xms1024m -Xmx1024m"`  |
| X_PROXY_NAME | The FQDN used by anyone accessing jira from outside (i.e. The FQDN of the proxy server/ingress controller) | jira.example.com |
| X_PROXY_PORT | The public facing port, not the jira container port | `443` |
| X_PROXY_SCHEME | The scheme used by the public facing proxy - normally https. | `https` |
| X_CONTEXT_PATH | The context path, if any. Best to leave blank. (This was formerly X_PATH. ) | |


## Get newest version from Atlassian

You can use Curl and jq to get the latest version og download link for the installed used in this repository. It makes it easy when you need to build a newer image.
```
curl -s https://my.atlassian.com/download/feeds/current/jira-software.json | sed 's\downloads(\\' | sed s'/.$//' | jq -r '.[] | select(.platform=="Unix") | "Url:" + .zipUrl, "Version:" + .version, "Edition:" + .edition'
```
Output :
```
Url:https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/downloads/binary/atlassian-jira-software-8.4.0-x64.bin
Version:8.4.0
Edition:Standard

```

## Linter

You can use a linter that analyze source code to flag programming errors, bugs, stylistic errors, and suspicious constructs. There is [dockerlinter](https://github.com/RedCoolBeans/dockerlint) , which does this quite easily.

### Installation
```
$ sudo npm install -g dockerlint
```

### Usage:
```
dockerlint Dockerfile
```

Above command will parse the file and notify you about any actual errors (such an omitted tag when : is set), and warn you about common pitfalls or bad idiom such as the common use case of ADD. In order to treat warnings as errors, use the -p flag.
